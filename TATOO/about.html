          <p> Wassup! Name's Aza. If you're on this page, you probably expect some award flexing and bragging. I'm not like that. I got no awards, my biggest achievement are happy customers that come back. </p>
          <p>Since I gained contiosness I always liked heavy music, naturally I have been exposed to visuals of tattoos very early and have come to like them very much. I wanted to get some too, I have been dreaming of them, drawing them on myself with permament markers and not even thinking about the pain level.</p>    
          <p>At 15 god has probably heard my prayer and I have got my hands on a tattoo gun I ordered from . Honestly the best purchase. I have been training on myself since then, before proceeding onto my friends and then other people.</p>
     

          <p>Thanks for reading yall. See you in the chair?</p>
